# InDepthUnpacking
Course content for teaching malware anti-analysis techniques and mitigations, with emphasis on packers.

The Ontology.csv file is a [work in progress] listing of known anti-analysis techniques and mitigations, along with references where applicable.  The category field is my own attempt to organize the anti-analysis techniques.  Category values are defined thus:
* STC = anti-static
* DBG = anti-debug
* EMU = anti-emulation
* SBX = anti-sandbox
* DMP = anti-dump
